# ld48 - Jupiter drop

You're an eccentric explorer diving into the depths of Jupiter with a
bathysphere to discover what is at its core. You must balance energy requirements,
risk hazards, upgrade your bathysphere with money you make from selling science
and mined elements.

## Game features

x Can see your ship and bathysphere descending on screen via a depth gauge
x Can see what layer you're at based on depth
x Can see outside temperature as you descend
x Can see pressure as you descend
x Can see power as you descend in kilowatt hours
x Can see hull health as you descend
x If hull health reaches zero it implodes and you die
x You can sell excess hydrogen
x Ship power is refueled via hydrogen you capture, fusion reactor
x If you run out of power you die
x add self destruct
x Can vary the speed of descent with down arrow ( velocity )
x make dropship bigger, you basically park in it
x If internal temp gets too high you die
x Your ship dissipates heat at a controlled amount can see internal temperature
x Can see a diagram of our bathysphere in between drops and click on parts to upgrade
x Can equip bigger sample tanks to catch elements, but they slow you down
* Sinking too fast or using more power slowed down air conditioning
* lightning knocks out power
* Can reroute power to devices (air-conditioning, speed)
* Can upgrade air-conditioning
* can upgrade hull strength
* can upgrade descent speed
* as you make discoveries / science, opens up new components to purchase
* You can see the different layers change visually as you get further
* Elements are displayed as big clouds
* Can equip minor steering to sway in the direction of clouds
* Reaching new depths unlocks science that makes you money
* can buy radar to steer towards elements and interesting objects
x ship has an inventory you can store and swap out bathysphere components
* can equip special hull layers that are consumable
* metallic hydrogen is very valuable
* metallic hydrogen overpowers the ship, must dissipate energy fast
* can see an atmosphereic wake as it descends
* can see a overhead scale of the atmosphere
* flash "out of power"
* can see power demand as power icons

## Jupiter facts

upper atmo 90% hydro 10% hel
four layers
67,000 KM radius
core is %30-50 of radius

1. layered atmosphere 3000km
   1. exosphere 3000km 0K -279.67f
   2. thermosphere 1000km 1000K 1340f
   3. stratosphere 320km 100K -279.67f
   4. troposphere 50km 1 bar 100K -279.67f
      1. clouds, weather, trace amounts methane, water, ammonia, silicon
2. liquid molecular hydrogen starts at -132km 10 bars 152f
3. liquid metallic hydrogen starts at -13,400Km,  8,540f 1.5e+6 bars
4. core - silicon, rock, diamond starts at -40,200Km, the bottom, goal 35,500f, 4.5e+7 bars

## hazards
micro meteorites
lightning
high speed winds, storm, cyclone
magnetic fields
heat, hot spots
pressure
monsters?
